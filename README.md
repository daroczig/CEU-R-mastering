This is the R script/materials repository of the "[Mastering R Skills](https://courses.ceu.edu/courses/2022-2023/mastering-r-skills)" course in the 2022/2023 Spring term, part of the [MSc in Business Analytics](https://courses.ceu.edu/programs/ms/master-science-business-analytics) at CEU. For the previous edition, see [2018/2019 Spring](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-R-mastering/tree/2018-2019), [2019/2020 Spring](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-R-mastering/tree/2019-2020), and [2020/2021 Spring](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-R-mastering/tree/2020-2021).

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

0. Bookmark, watch or star this repository so that you can easily find it later.
1. Please bring your own laptop and make sure to install R and RStudio **before** attending the first class!

    ðŸ’ª R packages to be installed from CRAN via `install.packages`:

    * `data.table`
    * `httr`
    * `jsonlite`
    * `lubridate`
    * `ggplot2`
    * `scales`
    * `zoo`
    * `RMySQL`
    * `RSQLite`
    * `openxlsx`
    * `googlesheets4`
    * `devtools`
    * `roxygen2`
    * `pander`
    * `logger`
    * `botor` (requires Python and the `boto3` Python module)
    * `purrr`
    * `memoise`

    ðŸ’ª R packages to be installed from GitHub via `remotes::install_github`:

    * `daroczig/binancer`
    * `daroczig/logger`
    * `daroczig/dbr`

    If you get stuck, feel free to use the preconfigured, shared RStudio Server at http://mr.ceudata.net/rstudio (I will share the usernames and passwords at the start of the class). In such case, you can skip all the steps prefixed with "ðŸ’ª" as the server already have that configured.

2. Join the #ba-mr-2022 Slack channel in the `ceu-bizanalytics` Slack group.
3. If you do not already have a GitHub account, create one
4. Create a new GitHub repository called `mastering-r`
4. Optionally create a new GitHub repository called `mastering-r` (or similar), but can be done later as well for th e R package (see below).
5. ðŸ’ª Install `git` from https://git-scm.com/
6. ðŸ’ª Verify that in RStudio, you can see the path of the `git` executable binary in the Tools/Global Options menu's "Git/Svn" tab -- if not, then you might have to restart RStudio (if you installed git after starting RStudio) or installed git by not adding that to the PATH on Windows. Either way, browse the "git executable" manually (in some `bin` folder look for thee `git` executable file).
8. Create an RSA key via Tools/Global options/Git/Create RSA Key button (optionally with a passphrase for increased security -- that you have to enter every time you push and pull to and from GitHub), then copy the public key (from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) and add that to you SSH keys on your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new).
9. Create a new project in RStudio choosing "version control", then "git" and paste the SSH version of the repo URL copied from GitHub (from point 4) in the pop-up -- now RStudio should be able to download the repo. If it asks you to accept GitHub's fingerprint, say "Yes".
9. If RStudio/git is complaining that you have to set your identity, click on the "Git" tab in the top-right panel, then click on the Gear icon and then "Shell" -- here you can set your username and e-mail address in the command line, so that RStudio/git integration can work. Use the following commands:

    ```sh
    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "Your e-mail address"
    ```

    Close this window, commit, push changes, all set.

## Class materials

### Report on the current price of 0.42 BTC

We have 0.42 Bitcoin. Let's write an R script reporting on the current value of this asset in USD.

<details>
  <summary>Click here for a hint ...</summary>

  We installed the `binancer` package for a reason! Look up the related functions via `help(package = binancer)`.
</details>

  <summary>Click here for a potential solution ...</summary>

```r
## library(devtools)
## install_github('daroczig/binancer')

library(binancer)
coin_prices <- binance_coins_prices()
coin_prices[symbol == 'BTC', usd]

## don't forget that we need to report on the price of 0.42 BTC instead of 1 BTC
coin_prices[symbol == 'BTC', usd * 0.42]
```

</details>

### Report on the current price of 0.42 BTC in EUR

Let's do the same report as above, but instead of USD, now let's report in Euros.

<details>

```r
## How to get EUR/HUF rate?
## See eg https://exchangerate.host for free API access

## Loading data without any dependencies
## https://api.exchangerate.host/latest
## https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=USD

readLines('https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=USD')

## Parse JSON
library(jsonlite)
fromJSON(readLines('https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=USD'))
fromJSON('https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=USD')

## Extract the USD/HUF exchange rate from the list
usdeur <- fromJSON('https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=USD&symbols=EUR')$rates$EUR
coin_prices[symbol == 'BTC', 0.42 * usd * usdeur]
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Click here for a potential solution ... after cleaning up</summary>

```r
## loading requires packages on the top of the script
library(binancer)
library(httr)

## constants
BITCOINS <- 0.42

## get Bitcoin price in USD
coin_prices <- binance_coins_prices()
btcusdt <- coin_prices[symbol == 'BTC', usd]

## get USD/HUF exchange rate
usdeur <- fromJSON('https://api.exchangerate.host/lat?base=USD&symbols=EUR')$rates$EUR

## report
BITCOINS * btcusdt * usdeur
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Click here for a potential solution ... with logging</summary>

```r
library(binancer)
library(httr)
library(data.table)
library(logger)

BITCOINS <- 0.42

coin_prices <- binance_coins_prices()
log_info('Found {coin_prices[, .N]} coins on Binance')
btcusdt <- coin_prices[symbol == 'BTC', usd]
log_info('The current Bitcoin price is ${btcusdt}')

usdeur <- fromJSON('https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=USD&symbols=EUR')$rates$EUR
log_info('1 USD currently costs {usdeur} EUR')

log_eval(forint(BITCOINS * btcusdt * usdeur), level = INFO)
log_info('{BITCOINS} Bitcoins now worth {round(btcusdt * usdeur * BITCOINS)} EUR')
```
